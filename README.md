"#The developed system processes campaign data containing message content and
scheduled times, resolves relevant locations, and retrieves hourly weather forecasts
using external APIs. Key meteorological variables, including temperature, precipitation,
wind speed, and humidity, are analyzed through a rule-based scoring approach to
assess weather suitability. The system identifies optimal time windows and presents
the results in standardized, exportable tables, allowing Wellpack to enhance campaign
scheduling efficiency and improve overall decision-making."
